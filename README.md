# Calculating fill level


## Summary

This project is a starting point for using ML to detect fill level of a confined space containing garbage in my garage, using a raspberry zero fitted with a wide-angle camera. When this confined space has been filled to a certain level (e.g. 75%), a service event will be sent to my mobile, stating that it's time to take the garbage to the recycling facility.


## Background

The motivation to do this project is personal, as to use ML in a practical way. However, I'm sure that this also could be applied in more commercial settings.



## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources are mine. 
AI methods will be added later.

## What next?

The next step would be to calculate approx. weight somehow, by analysing images further.


## Acknowledgments
