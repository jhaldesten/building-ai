This is a testing ground for AI


# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is a starting point for using ML to detect fill level of a confined space containing garbage in my garage, using a raspberry zero fitted with a wide-angle camera. When this confined space has been filled to a certain level (e.g. 75%), a service event will be sent to my mobile, stating that it's time to take the garbage to the recycling facility.


## Background

The motivation to do this project is personal, as to use ML in a practical way. However, I'm sure that this also could be applied in more commercial settings.



## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |


## What next?

The next step would be to calculate approx. weight somehow, by analysing images further.
